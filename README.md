# Work Day Scheduler

## About

This work day scheduler has the following requirements:

- Functions as a daily planner to create a schedule
- Opening the planner displays the current day at the top of the calendar
- Scrolling down shows future time blocks
- Time blocks shows past, current hour, and future blocks in different colors
- Clicking time blocks triggers a DOM event to edit text for that time block
- Clicking on the "Save" button for that time block saves the data in local storage
